About this project
I made these registraion forms after watching Code 30 things in 30 days with CSS3 made by Brad Hussey Â©2018 Brightside Studios Inc. The top registration form I created by following along to the 4th video in the series. I plan to embark on the #100DaysofCode challenge. This project was my day 1. You can follow along with my coding journey on my Twitter, Instagram, or Github.
